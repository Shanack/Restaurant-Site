Basic Structure
============================================

<br/>

<a name="home"></a> Home Page
======================================


 <img src="https://github.com/arfatkh/Restaurant-Site/blob/main/imgs/image6.png" width="800" height="auto">



The Home Page was created by diving the page into Bootstrap container and taking each part as a Row. The title as well as most of the other elements are position by using “position : relative” . The footer in this case has a video background. The Background images were obtained from pexels.com 






<br/>

<a name="menu"></a>Menu Page
======================================



 <img src="https://github.com/arfatkh/Restaurant-Site/blob/main/imgs/image5.png" width="800" height="auto">
 The menu page is based on bootstrap’s cards, which are nicely edited. The entire page is given a background image. The real challenge was to get the first card perfect after that we reused the same card code.


<br/>

<a name="deals"></a> Deals Page
=======================================



 <img src="https://github.com/arfatkh/Restaurant-Site/blob/main/imgs/image13.png" width="800" height="auto">



Like the Menu page, the deals page is also based upon bootstrap cards which are precisely edited and formatted.!

===========================================

A single Navigation bar is used in the entire website with its own css file , this means editing a single file will edit the entire site. For Icons , fontawesomes were used.
